//
// handover.go is the proof that a respawn actually happened. forkChild() can only report
// that a child was CREATED, and every fatal state the shared parser cannot see -- an
// invalid WordChars/WordHead/OFF/ON/SEQ regex, a duplicated OFF/ON/SEQ declaration, an
// unresolvable key name, a [ScanDevices] Test device that is not there -- kills that child
// AFTER the parent has already let go. main() recovers from each of those panics and
// returns, so the child exits successfully and the keyboard is simply gone while the GUI
// has been told it respawned.
//
// The proof the parent waits for is the child taking over the IPC socket, and the reason
// that is decidable is where serve() binds it: listenIPC() is the last step of the boot
// sequence, so a process answering on that path has already gotten through config(),
// sequences(), keys(), the device scan, the virtual keyboard, inotify and X11. A child
// that dies therefore dies with the parent's socket untouched, which is what lets the
// parent refuse the handover and keep serving.
